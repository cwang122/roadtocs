<p>
On Oct.2nd.2019, I have launched a series of projects combined with onlines courses, online CS learning community and github open-sources projects. This effort is to build a strong foundation of computer science for further academic and professional purposes. 
</p>



<h3>Project length: 2019.10 to 2020.8</h3>

<p>
The Goal: by the end of this project, we will reach the intermediate software develper level with solid CS foundation.
</p>


<h4>Phase 1: (Starting from 2019.10) We will complete the following foundation courses through university open-courses.</h4>

  1. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python (MIT 6.0001) - edX
  2. How to Code - Simple Data - edX
  3. How to Code - Complex Data - edX
  4. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization</a> - Coursera
      - Specialization with 5 courses, proceed in max speed.
  5. Algorithmic Design and Techniques - edX UCSD MicroMaster element
  6. Data Structures Fundamentals - edX UCSD MicroMaster element
  7. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Algorithms Specialization</a> - Coursera Stanford
  
     [IF TIME LIMITED] GO ALT: [Require Java!]
      - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1">Algorithms, Part I</a> - Coursera Princeton
      - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2">Algorithms, Part II</a> - Coursera Princeton
  
<h4>Phase 2: (Expected Starting by 2020.2)</h4>

  5. Operating System - ops-class.org - Hack the Kernel
  6. Compiler - Stanford Lagunita
